# 🎬 Movie Ratings Explorer

**Author:** Visura Rodrigo  
**Course:** Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python (IBM)  
**Dataset:** IMDb Top 1000 Movies (`imdb_top_1000.csv`)  

---

## 📌 Overview

This project demonstrates how to explore and analyze a structured movie dataset using SQL and Python together inside a Jupyter Notebook. The dataset includes IMDb’s top 1000 movies, and the analysis is done using SQL queries via `%sql` magic, then visualized with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.

## 🗂️ Contents

- Load movie data from CSV
- Store it into an SQLite database
- Connect SQL queries to Jupyter using `ipython-sql`
- Perform exploratory SQL analysis (ratings, genres, revenue)
- Visualize trends using Python (runtime, rating, gross earnings)
